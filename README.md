# Security System

## Overview
This project is a basic security system developed using Arduino and RFID technology. The system is designed to authenticate access to a secure area by scanning RFID tags.

## Features
- Utilizes an RFID reader to scan RFID tags for authentication
- Controls access to a secure area based on successful authentication
- Arduino microcontroller is used to control the system
- Hardware components are designed and built for the system
- RFID reader is configured to communicate with the microcontroller

## Project Details
- **Project Date**: March 2020
- **GitHub Repository**: gh repo clone Geo-y20/Security-system

## Technologies Used
- Arduino
- RFID technology

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the GitHub repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`
2. Connect the RFID reader to the Arduino microcontroller according to the provided circuit diagram.
3. Upload the Arduino sketch to the microcontroller.
4. Configure the RFID reader settings according to the specifications.

## Usage
1. Power on the security system.
2. Present an RFID tag to the RFID reader for authentication.
3. The system will verify the tag and grant access to the secure area if authenticated.
4. Monitor the system logs or feedback for any status or error messages.

## Customization
- You can customize the system by modifying the Arduino sketch to add more functionality or integrate additional sensors or components.
- Adjust the RFID reader settings as needed to meet specific requirements.
